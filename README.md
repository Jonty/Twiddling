Twiddling
=========

Twiddling is a few twitter toys I've built to satisfy my own needs, some of them have become 
somewhat popular.

Twintersect
-----------

Twintersect intersects your twitter friends with another user in various ways, so you can work
out how you're linked together. It also has a rather handy bookmarklet.

Twerverse
---------

Twerverse inspects your friends and followers to work out who you're following that's not 
following you. It's both informative and vaguely upsetting.
